# My CTF labs Writeup
This is a collection of labs that I had done in the past. All of the answers are censored as I believe this will not help anyone, but be detrimental to learning progress.
Currently, all of the labs are from HTB; but I'm looking forward to expand my scope to other websites in the future.

## Why?
- I want to solidify my techniques and information that I have gained in form of writing. As there's an enormous amount of Tools&Techniques I need to learn as a beginner, I want to learn everything and don't just forgets it two days after.
- I want to get into habit of taking notes, as it'll be reference in case that I forget something; and maybe help some people in the future who's new to CTF like me.
- I hope to apply a knowledge that I had learned from the learning platform (HTB Academy/TryHackMe), with ridiculous amount of text that makes me dizzy every two seconds, I'm confident that this more effective method for me.
